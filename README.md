"In this final lab, you are going to create a portfolio page for yourself. You will be using the skills you have learned in this course to create a page that showcases your work. The portfolio page will be a single page that will contain the following sections:

- A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page
- A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio
